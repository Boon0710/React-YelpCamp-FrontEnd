# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

YelpCamp is the project that I followed along in the course "The Web Developer BootCamp 2024", this project previously use ejs as front end. Since I am currently learning React, I decided to make a brand new UI for the project using React. I also added a few pages and components that are not taught in the course.
